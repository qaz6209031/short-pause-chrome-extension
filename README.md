# ⏸ Pause — Short Video Chrome Extension

Break the autopilot. A mindful pause before TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

🌐 **Homepage:** [kaichin.dev/short-pause-chrome-extension](https://kaichin.dev/short-pause-chrome-extension)

## What it does

Every time you open a short video feed, Pause stops you for 5 seconds and asks one question: *is this really what you want to do right now?*

No hard blocks. No shame. Just friction — right at the moment of autopilot.

## Features

- **Pause screen** — intercepts TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts before the feed loads
- **Why are you here?** — pick a reason (bored, stressed, procrastinating, taking a break) to build self-awareness
- **5-second countdown** — a small delay to break the reflex
- **Resist tracking** — logs every time you chose to go back
- **Streak** — consecutive days you stayed mindful
- **10-minute cooldown** — won't interrupt again on the same site after you dismiss
- **On/off toggle** — disable without uninstalling
- **100% local** — no account, no server, no data leaves your device
